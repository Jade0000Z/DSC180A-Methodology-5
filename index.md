**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I found generative AI models and predictive models particularly interesting for misinformation detection.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to investigate the use of fractal chains of thought (FCOT) to achieve higher accuracy in processing and analysis.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would refine the approach to focus on improving scalability and integrating more advanced iterative methods.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am interested in exploring graph databases as an alternative to vector databases to evaluate their impact on the accuracy and efficiency of results.
